# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results: 

* How is the district summary affected? District summary data didn't affected much as it only change by average math score by 0.1, passing math percentage by 0.2%, passing reading percentage by 0.1% , overall passing percentage by 0.3%  and Average Reading Score  didn't change . This is expected as the number of student in 9th grade from Thomas High School is low compared to total student in the district.
